# Why? 

While working on [ruby](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/ruby) I had to refactor the OpenGL pipeline quite often. The problem with that implementation is that it relies heavily on the CPU/GPU/RAM/VRAM implementations and it's not so straightforward to visualize changes until you have every single piece of the pipeline working. This is the same OpenGL pipeline implementation, just without the PlayStation emulation, which will hopefully allow me to try out changes in isolation way faster.
